#### Acknowledgements

I would like to think my professor Dr. John A. Walsh and my class' associate instructor Alex Wingate for their valuable feedback and assistance with all things technical. I am very grateful to my mother Jane Howard, who carefully removed many postcards from my childhood bedroom door and brough them to me when she visited Bloomington earlier this semester. I would also like to thank my father Larry Scheving for allowing me to use his personal scanner. Finally, I would like to thank my classmates, especially Casey Machenheimer, Josh Peters, and Julia Parkinson for providing much needed emotional and technical support.
