## Technical Information

This page includes various technical information about the creation of this website.

#### Imaging Standards

For this project, I used an [Epson Perfection V550 Photo Color Scanner](https://epson.com/Clearance-Center/Scanners/Epson-Perfection-V550-Photo-Color-Scanner/p/B11B210201) to digitize my postcards. I originally saved my scans as PDFs but later converted them to JPEGs in order to ensure that previews of each card appeared when browsing the website.

#### Metadata Application Profile

The following PDF explains the metadata standards used to create this project.

#### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank professor Dr. John A. Walsh and associate instructor Alex Wingate for their valuable feedback and assistance with all things technical. I am very grateful to my mother Jane Howard, who carefully removed many postcards from my childhood bedroom door and brought them to Bloomington when she visited earlier this semester. I would also like to thank my father Larry Scheving for allowing me to use his personal scanner. Finally, I would like to thank my classmates, especially Casey Machenheimer, Josh Peters, and Julia Parkinson, for providing much needed emotional and technical support throughout the semester.
